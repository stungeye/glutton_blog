This blog is maintained by [Kyle Geske](http://stungeye.com), a computer engineer, [college](http://rrc.ca) web development instructor, and artist from [Winnipeg](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winnipeg), Manitoba, Canada.

The goal of this website is to document my work developing mobile application using only web technologies. I don't own a smartphone, so all testing will be emulated. Finished apps will be deployed to the Android Market, and perhaps even to iTunes if I buy an Apple developer license.

All code samples displayed within the posts on this blog are released free and unencumbered software into the public domain. Read [The Unlicense](http://unlicense.org/) for more information.
