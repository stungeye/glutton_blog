This blog is maintained by [Kyle Geske](http://stungeye.com), a computer engineer, [college](http://rrc.ca) web development instructor, and artist from [Winnipeg](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winnipeg), Manitoba, Canada.

The goal of this website is to document my work developing mobile application using only web technologies. Finished apps will be deployed to the Android Market, and perhaps even to iTunes if I buy an Apple developer license.
